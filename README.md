# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Data-Analysis
Hands‚Äëon fraud detection project using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset. End‚Äëto‚Äëend workflow from data assessment and feature engineering to rule‚Äëbased investigation, anomaly detection, and dashboarding. Showcases Python analytics, visualizations, and stakeholder reporting for real‚Äëworld fraud prevention.

## üîç General Fraud Detection Workflow  

1. **Data Assessment**  
   - Load the credit card transactions dataset and inspect its structure  
   - Quantify class imbalance (fraud vs. legitimate)  
   - Note data characteristics (anonymized features, timestamp resolution, amount distribution)  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handle missing or invalid values (if any)  
   - Standardize data types (e.g. parse timestamps, ensure numeric fields)  
   - Deduplicate and filter out any obviously corrupt records  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract time‚Äëbased features (hour of day, day of week, time since previous transaction)  
   - Bucket transaction amounts or compute rolling‚Äëwindow statistics per cardholder  
   - Derive behavioral metrics (transaction frequency, merchant diversity)  
   - (Optional) Geolocation or device‚Äêbased features if supplemental data is available  

4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Compare distributions of key features for fraud vs. non‚Äëfraud  
   - Visualize class imbalance and highlight any temporal spikes in fraud  
   - Use correlation analysis or feature‚Äêimportance from a simple model to identify top predictors  

5. **Rule‚ÄëBased Investigation**  
   - Define a handful of ‚Äúred‚Äëflag‚Äù rules (e.g., very high amounts at odd hours)  
   - Measure how many frauds and false positives each rule catches  
   - Refine thresholds based on precision/recall trade‚Äëoffs  

6. **Anomaly Detection (Optional)**  
   - Apply an unsupervised technique (e.g., Isolation Forest, PCA) to flag outliers  
   - Evaluate how well anomalies align with labeled fraud cases  
   - Combine rule‚Äëbased and anomaly scores for improved coverage  

7. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Select metrics aligned with business goals (precision, recall, F1, ROC‚ÄëAUC)  
   - Use appropriate validation strategy (stratified split or time‚Äëbased split)  
   - Document model or rule thresholds and expected alert volumes  

8. **Reporting & Dashboarding**  
   - Summarize key findings and metrics in a concise report or notebook  
   - Export summary tables (e.g., fraud rate by hour, rule performance) to CSV or Google Sheets  
   - Build a simple dashboard (Looker Studio / Google Data Studio) showing:
     - Overall fraud rate over time  
     - Alerts by rule or model version  
     - KPI scorecards (precision/recall)  

9. **Documentation & Handoff**  
   - Write a clear README covering project objective, data schema, workflow steps, and how to reproduce  
   - Include visual highlights (plots or GIFs) and an optional video walkthrough link  
   - Organize repository with folders for raw data pointers, cleaned data, notebooks, scripts, and dashboard assets
